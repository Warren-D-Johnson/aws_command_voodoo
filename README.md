### AWS Command Voodoo

One of the best pieces of advice I received at the start of my career was to create a file named command_voodoo.txt and use it to log various tips, tricks, syntax and other helpful items you discover during your journey.  Its a great resource for commands or syntax you use infrequently.  I've primarily used AWS CLI Version 2 and Javascript AWS-SDK Version 2.  Commands and syntax may vary between versions.  In this repository, I've posted some samples from my personal Command Voodoo file including:

* cron related
* complete deletions of files
* file manipulation
* image manipulation
* video manipulation

*Bonus, I included some IAM policies in a separate folder!*<br>

I have a separate repository for Linux CLI related entries from my Command Voodoo file.
