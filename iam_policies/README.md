### Sample IAM Policies

A sample of some IAM policies you may find useful.  You should follow the philosophy of "least privilege" when creating IAM policies.<br>
<br>
Note: Some of them are a tad more permissive than others but that is easily refined.  How permissive they are depended on the client and the circumstance.  
<br>
Note 2: IAM policies don't support a "comment" property but there was no other way to annotate the files without messing up the pretty JSON syntax highlighting.<br>
